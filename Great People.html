	<center><h2>Companys : Tesla,SpaceX,Twitter,The Boring Company,Neuralink</h2></center>
	<p><b>Elon Reeve Musk</b> is a business magnate and investor. 
	He is the founder, CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO and product architect 
	of Tesla, Inc.; owner, CTO and chairman of Twitter; founder of the Boring Company and X Corp.; 
	co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the philanthropic Musk Foundation. Musk is 
	the wealthiest person in the world according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes's Real
	Time Billionaires list as of June 2023, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX, with
	an estimated net worth of around $225 billion according to Bloomberg and $235 billion according to Forbes<p>
	<h1>Education</h1>
	<p>Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and Pretoria Boys High School, 
	from which he graduated. Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother, 
	knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way. While waiting for his application 
	to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months</p>
	<h1>SpaceX</h1>
	<p>In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place 
	a growth-chamber for plants on Mars. In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell
	and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads 
	into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and the group	returned to
	the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. </p>
	<h1>Starlink</h1>
	<p>In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite 
	Internet access, with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the 
	first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.</P>
	<h1>Tesla</h1>
	<p>Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series
	A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round 
	of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.
	Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations</P>

	<center><h2>Name     : Jeffrey Preston Bezos </h2></center>
	<center><h2>Born : 12 January 1964 (age 59 years), Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States</h2></center>
	<center><h2>Parents :  Ted Jorgensen, Miguel Bezos, Jacklyn Bezos </h2></center>
	<p>Jeffrey Preston Bezos is an American entrepreneur, media proprietor, investor, and commercial astronaut. He is the founder,
	executive chairman, and former president and CEO of Amazon, the world's largest e-commerce and cloud computing company. With a 
	net worth of US$125 billion as of April 2023, Bezos is the third-wealthiest person in the world and was the wealthiest from 2017 to 2021, according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes.</p>
	<h1>Business career</h1>
	<h2>Early career</h2>
	<p>After Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs at Intel, Bell Labs, and Andersen Consulting, among others.
	He first worked at Fitel, a fintech telecommunications start-up, where he was tasked with building a network for international trade.
    Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry
	when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust from 1988 to 1990. He then joined D. E. Shaw & Co, a newly created hedge fund with 
	a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling from 1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president by age 30.</p>
	<h2>Amazon</h2>
	<p>In spring 1994, Bezos read that web usage was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and eventually decided to establish an online 
	bookstore.He and his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage in Bellevue,
	Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing its business plan on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle. With Bezos at
	the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's
	first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially. Prior to settling on Seattle,
	Bezos had investigated setting up his company at an Indian reservation near San Francisco in order to avoid paying taxes.
	Bezos initially named his new company Cadabra but later changed the name to Amazon after the Amazon River in South America, 
	in part because the name begins with the letter A, which is at the beginning of the alphabet. At the time, website listings
	were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches. In addition, he
	regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online 
	bookstore. He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon. He warned many early investors that 
	there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt. Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had 
	always planned to expand to other products. Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with an initial public 
	offering (IPO).	In response to critical reports from Fortune and Barron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would
	overtake competition from larger book retailers such as Borders and Barnes & Noble.</P>
	<h2>Blue Origin</h2>
	<p>In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup. Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel 
	and the development of human life in the Solar System.[36] His 1982 high school valedictorian senior graduation speech was followed 
	up with a Miami Herald interview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for 
	human beings who were in orbit.The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse through resource depletion.
	Rob Meyerson led Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.</p>
